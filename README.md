1. Install Required Python Packages: Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


2. Specify the Absolute Path for Your CSV File: Make sure to provide the absolute path to the CSV file you intend to use. For example, instead of using a relative path like data/file.csv, use something like C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/data/file.csv.

3. Update Paths for Other Necessary Files: Similarly, ensure that all other text files or resources required by your program also have their absolute paths specified. This will help avoid any file not found errors during execution.

4. Run Your Program: After setting everything up, you can now run your Python program. Make sure to check that all paths and dependencies are correctly configured to ensure smooth execution.
